# Deadwood_distribution_Europe
Repository containing the results of modelling deadwood stocks in European forests based on the ICP network deadwood survey. The datasets include current estimated potential deadwood amounts, as well as estimates based on future climate and management scenarios. Deadwood stocks are reported in mÂ³/ha. 

## Current deadwood distribution 
The current deadwood potential (current_deadwood_potential.tif) file displays the deadwood stocks under current forest conditions. 

## Future deadwood distribution
The future deadwood potential (future deadwood_potential.tif) file is composed by 6 layers accroding to future climate and management scenarios: 
* RCP45_2050: current management and RCP4.5 climate by mid century
* RCP_85_2050: current management and RCP8.5 climate by mid century
* RCP45_2100: current management and RCP4.5 climate by the end of the century
* RCP_85_2100:  current management and RCP8.5 climate by the end of the century
* Management: biodiversity oriented  management and current climate
* Management_RCP_45: biodiversity oriented management and RCP4.5 climate by the end of the century

Biodiversity-oriented management considers a simultaneous increase in forest age and expansion of mixed forest areas,
with the corresponding modifications in aboveground biomass and tree density
